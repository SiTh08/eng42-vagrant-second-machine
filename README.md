## Git and Branching

from master & a clean working team:
  git checkout -b name-branch

pushing a branch (once added and committed on a branch):
  git push origin <branch-name>

go to GitHub and merge branch to master

  go to GitHub and merge branch to master

what happens is the master timeline in GitHub is a head of you local timeline. So now we need to pull from GitHub:

In our local master:

git pull origin master
